## How?

![](http://pcs7p33sr.bkt.clouddn.com/ca429c26-b378-aece-9ffa-050a3b945f49)

* The extension spawn a electron process for read image in clipborad via electron api `clipboard.readImage`.
* send the image to [tinyPng](https://tinypng.com/) for size optimization.
* send the image to CDN for hosting

## Extension Settings

| Setting | type | default | desc |
| -- | -- | -- | --|
| markdownPasteImage.tinyPngKey | string | '' | the tiny png developer key, refer to the [doc](https://tinypng.com/developers) |
| markdownPasteImage.cdnType | string | "qiniu" |  cdn type, currently only support qiniu |
| markdownPasteImage.qiniuBucket | string | "" | qiniu cdn's bucket name |

| markdownPasteImage.qiniuSK | string | "" | qiniu cdn's security key |
| markdownPasteImage.qiniuPreUrl | string | "" | qiniu cdn's pre-url  |

## Limitations

1. extension size is big, because we need bundle electron in the package
2. the extension will start a electron process.
3. only support mac os currently, should be easy to support other platform, PR welcomed
4. only support qiniu CDN, should be easy support others, such as Amozon S3 and Azure storage.
5. can not support `gif` due to the [limitation of electron api](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/8485).

## PR welcomed
1. support more platforms
2. support more CDN，refer to [current code](https://github.com/njleonzhang/vscode-extension-mardown-image-paste/blob/master/src/CdnUploader/)
